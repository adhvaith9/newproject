Lambda programming Model
-------------------------
What is Lambda?
  -->A serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events
  -->underlying compute resources managed for you.
  -->stops and starts in milliseconds.
  -->pay only for the time your code takes to execute.
LAMBDA:
  -->lambda is a serverless,serverless allows you to run your
     application code in the cloud without having to worry about
     managing any servers.
competitive advantage of lambda over EC2;
   -->speed to market:
     By eliminating the overhead of managing servers,you can
     release code quickly and get your application to 
     market faster 
   -->super scalable:
     You can have a million users on your website and everything 
     will scale automatically.
   -->Lower costs:
     you never pay for over-provisioning.serverless applications
     are event-driven and you are only charged when your code is 
     executed.
   -->Focus on your application:
      AWS offers a range of serverless technologies which
      integrate seamlesslly.Allowing you to focus on building 
      great applications.
- Handlers files and functions -> the entry point for lambda invocations
- Events -> the incoming data passed to a lambda function when triggered
- Context -> Provides methods and properties that provide information about the invocation , function and execution environments
- Logging -> handled via Cloudwatch logs
- Exception -> success or failure is communicated to AWS
